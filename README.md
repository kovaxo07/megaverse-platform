# Megaverse Platform — Static Frontend

Minimal static site for The Megaverse. Contains a landing page, simple wallet connect placeholder, and a merchant application form ready for Netlify deploy.

What’s included
- `index.html` — landing page with wallet connect placeholder and merchant application form
- `script.js` — minimal client-side code for wallet button placeholder
- `style.css` — basic styles
- `success.html` — post-submit page for the Netlify form

How to use
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
- To enable the Netlify form, deploy the site to Netlify (drag-and-drop the folder or push to a repo and connect the site).

Notes & next steps
- Integrate a Web3 provider (Ethers.js or Web3Modal) into `script.js` to connect wallets.
- Add build tooling if you want to use frameworks or preprocessors.
