creatomate_test.py

Central submission file for the Megaverse project.

Usage:
- Add your submission by calling submit(name, payload) from Python or by editing this file.
- Use `list_submissions()` to see what has been added.

This file intentionally keeps a simple in-memory registry for quick local testing. For
persistent records you can edit this file directly or extend the helpers below to write
to disk or push to an API.
